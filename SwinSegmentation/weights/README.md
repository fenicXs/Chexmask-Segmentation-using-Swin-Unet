# SwinSegmentation Weights

The original project distributes pretrained checkpoints separately. Download the desired `.pth` files from the Swin-Unet repository release page and place them in this folder before running inference or fine-tuning:

- `swin_tiny_patch4_window7_224.pth`
- `swin_base_patch4_window7_224.pth`

These files are excluded from version control to keep the repository size manageable. See `SwinSegmentation/download_weights.py` for scripted download options.
